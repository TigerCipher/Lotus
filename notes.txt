Bit of a todo list


== Script system
Lotus uses native C++ scripting

Editor will need to do the following ->
    - Create Visual Studio C++ solution and project
    - Add script files
    - Set the engine include and library paths
    - Force include GameEntity.h (contains ScriptEntity class)
    - Or maybe just Lotus.h
    - Set call convention to fastcall
    - Set Cpp language version to 20
    - Something like this ||
                          \/
    - foreward declare `class CharacterScript`
    - registerscript(std::hash<std::string>("CharacterScript"), &lotus::script::detail::create_script<CharacterScript>)


settings/preferences
    - Base Font Size?
    - Close visual studio when close the editor or not
    - Build on editor launch or not
    - Show visual studio when building or not (maybe option for only if there was an error?)
